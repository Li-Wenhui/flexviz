Bend Transformation Module

Transforms 2D PCB coordinates to 3D based on fold recipes from region subdivision.

================================================================================
OVERVIEW
================================================================================

The transformation is purely recipe-based: each region has a fold_recipe that
specifies exactly which folds affect it and how (IN_ZONE or AFTER).
No geometric re-classification is performed during transformation.

Recipe format: [(fold, classification, entered_from_back), ...]
  - fold: FoldDefinition with center, axis, zone_width, angle
  - classification: "IN_ZONE" (point is in bend zone) or "AFTER" (point is past bend)
  - entered_from_back: True if fold was entered from the AFTER side during BFS

================================================================================
FOLD GEOMETRY
================================================================================

A fold is defined by two parallel marking lines separated by zone_width.
The fold center is a reference point on the fold line (midway between markers).

Coordinate system relative to fold:
  - axis: unit vector along the fold line
  - perp: unit vector perpendicular to fold (direction of bending)
  - along: signed distance along the fold axis from center
  - perp_dist: signed distance perpendicular to fold from center
    * perp_dist < -hw: BEFORE the fold (hw = half_width = zone_width/2)
    * -hw <= perp_dist <= +hw: IN_ZONE (inside the bend)
    * perp_dist > +hw: AFTER the fold

The fold axis (rotation axis for the cylinder) is at the BEFORE boundary,
not at the fold center. This means:
  - At perp_dist = -hw: point is at the fold axis, no rotation yet
  - At perp_dist = +hw: point has rotated by the full fold angle

================================================================================
TRANSFORMATION MATH
================================================================================

1. IN_ZONE TRANSFORMATION (Cylindrical Mapping)
-----------------------------------------------
Points in the bend zone are mapped onto a cylindrical arc.

Given:
  - R = zone_width / |angle|  (bend radius)
  - dist_into_zone = perp_dist + hw  (distance from BEFORE boundary)
  - arc_fraction = dist_into_zone / zone_width
  - theta = arc_fraction * angle  (rotation angle at this point)

The point maps to local coordinates:
  - local_perp = R * sin(|theta|) - hw
  - local_up = R * (1 - cos(|theta|))  [negated if angle < 0]

At the BEFORE boundary (theta=0): local_perp = -hw, local_up = 0 (original position)
At the AFTER boundary (theta=angle): local_perp = R*sin(|angle|) - hw, local_up = R*(1-cos(|angle|))

2. AFTER TRANSFORMATION (Rotated Plane)
---------------------------------------
Points past the bend zone continue on a flat plane rotated by the fold angle.

The plane starts at the end of the IN_ZONE cylinder:
  - zone_end_perp = R * sin(|angle|) - hw
  - zone_end_up = R * (1 - cos(|angle|))

The excess distance beyond the zone is rotated:
  - excess = perp_dist - hw
  - local_perp = zone_end_perp + excess * cos(angle)
  - local_up = zone_end_up + excess * sin(angle)

3. CUMULATIVE TRANSFORMATION (Multiple Folds)
---------------------------------------------
For multiple folds, we track an affine transformation: pos_3d = rot @ pos_2d + origin

Each AFTER fold updates the cumulative transformation:
  - rot: 3x3 rotation matrix (composition of all fold rotations)
  - origin: 3D translation (accounts for cylindrical offsets)

The fold's local coordinate frame is transformed through the cumulative rotation:
  - fold_axis_3d = rot @ (axis.x, axis.y, 0)
  - fold_perp_3d = rot @ (perp.x, perp.y, 0)
  - up_3d = rot @ (0, 0, 1)

================================================================================
BACK ENTRY HANDLING
================================================================================

When BFS traverses the region graph, it may enter a fold from the "back" (AFTER side)
rather than the front (BEFORE side). This happens in multi-fold configurations where
the traversal path goes around the fold.

For back entry, we mirror the transformation:
  1. Negate perp_dist: measures distance from the opposite side
  2. Negate local_perp (IN_ZONE): cylinder axis is at AFTER boundary instead of BEFORE
  3. Negate zone_end_perp (AFTER): plane starts at the correct mirrored position

The fold angle is NOT negated - the bend direction remains consistent with the
physical fold angle, regardless of which side we entered from.

This ensures:
  - Continuity at IN_ZONE/AFTER boundary for back entry
  - Consistent bend direction (positive angle = bend up) regardless of entry side
  - Correct spatial positioning through perpendicular mirroring

    Transform a 2D point to 3D using a fold recipe.
